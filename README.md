# Fundamentals of Computing in Python Specialization
This is the archive for my work in the Online Course on Python by Rice University on Coursera

This Specialization covers much of the material that first-year Computer Science students take at Rice University. Students learn
sophisticated programming skills in Python from the ground up and apply these skills in building more than 20 projects. The
Specialization concludes with a Capstone exam that allows the students to demonstrate the range of knowledge that they have acquired in the Specialization.
